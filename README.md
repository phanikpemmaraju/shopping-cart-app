# Shopping Cart System

### Requirements

### *Step 1 - Shopping Cart*

You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges. Below are the prices of these fruits respectively.

  - Apples  =>  60p
  - Oranges => 25p

Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost.  

> For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05

Make reasonable *assumptions* about the inputs to your solution; For example, *many candidates take a list of strings as input*

### *Step 2 - Simple Offers*
The shop decides to introduce two new offers.

* [*Buy one, get one free*] - for Apples !
* [*3 for the price of 2*] - for Oranges !

Update your checkout functions accordingly.
